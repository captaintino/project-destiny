# Project Proposal #

Project-Destiny will be an ingenious new look at the genre of 2D top-scrolling video games! Designed to be simple to use and extremely addictive, this game will let a user maneuver a spaceship through an asteroid field and attempt to engage or avoid enemy ships.

**Points**
> Points will be scored for the amount of time a user's ship survives, and bonus points will be earned for destroying enemies. (e.g., 50 points/second + 25 points/alien kill). As the levels increase, the points scored will increase as well. (e.g., level 2: 60 points/second, + 30 points/alien kill, level 3: 70 points/second, + 35 points/alien kill)

**Lives**
> Sadly, the limited size of the player's starship affords no room for significant shielding, any contact with a celestial body or enemy ship will result in instantaneous destruction. Users start with a single ship, but at the bonus level will be able to collect extra ships to continue game play with if their ship is destroyed.

**Levels**
> The speed at which the asteroids and enemies come at the player will increase by something along the lines of Sqrt (1.5 x level) every 60 seconds of game play.

**Save/Load**
> The user will be able to press a hot key to save the game into an auto-save file at any point in the middle of a level, and will be able offered the opportunity to save to a custom file at the end of each level.

**Multiplayer Modes**
> Multiplayer competitive mode will allow users on separate computers to fly through the asteroid field together and compete for points while co-op mode allows users to work together for super-high score attempts!


What is "ingenious" about Project-Destiny? Well... have you ever heard of inter-dimensional travel?
